She is currently in her third year attending San Jose State University, She is a dynamic creator with a passion for exploring a wide range of artistic mediums. From digital and traditional illustrations to photography and video editing. She mainly uses programs like  Procreate and occasionally uses Adobe Premiere and Adobe Lightroom. For her photography, she uses a Nikon camera, she captures the beauty of the world around her, from the world’s nature to timeless statues. While she creates art she tends to focus more on growth as an artist using the medium, especially using influences of inspiration to help guide her. Some of her inspirations include her family, nature, and anime. Despite being an artist, she is still learning new skills and has yet to find any specific theme that her art focuses on but rather shares her experience of learning new mediums and uses her talents to be able to spread joy to others with her artworks.

Her hopes of learning a variety of art forms have opened her eyes more to the possibilities of what she can do to spread joy amongst others around the world. While she is learning new mediums she finds discoveries of love for art and new ways of expressing herself.
